        <h4>1/22/2026</h4>
        <p>For this week I have learned on how to make several pages and link them with one another and several new types of tags. The tags I have learned so far are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The 6 different heading tags (h1-h6)</li>
            <li>Paragraph tags (p)</li>
            <li>link tags (a)</li>
            <li>image tags (img)</li>
            <li>Most importantly how to open and close a tag!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Other things I have learned this week include the element (tag and contents between the opening and closing) alongside attributes (example being a href="" in a link tag.)</p>
        <br><p>As for the reading we had done chapter 1-3, In the first three chapters of Maisa Imamovic's book The Psychology of the Web Developer, Reality of a Female Freelancer <!--Figure out later how to italicize this later--> has three different perspective.
            The first goes through Imamovic's experience with the internet and its language through the useage of Spleck, a software that helps her learn English.
            Though through usage she develops a human like connection with the chatbot and the flaws of the software are revealed, as the bot functions more as a yes man and the responses feel hollow.
            The next chapters go over the viewpoints of Larry and Scott, where Larry's viewpoint shows love for building websites, though he is afraid to try anything new as to go against the status quo.
