        <h4>1/22/2026</h4>
        <p>For this week I have learned on how to make several pages and link them with one another and several new types of tags. The tags I have learned so far are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The 6 different heading tags (h1-h6)</li>
            <li>Paragraph tags (p)</li>
            <li>link tags (a)</li>
            <li>image tags (img)</li>
            <li>Most importantly how to open and close a tag!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Other things I have learned this week include the element (tag and contents between the opening and closing) alongside attributes (example being a href="" in a link tag.)</p>
